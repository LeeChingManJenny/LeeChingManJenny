## Individual Project
#### Stock Prediction through news analysis
*This project is an individual coding exercise. Please look at my repo __HSI_pred_byNewsAna__ if you are interested to it.*

This model is by calculating the features of news, and of stocks, to predict the precentage change of HSI.
It have criterion = nn.HuberLoss(delta=1.0) and Epoch 100: Train Loss = 0.3884, Val Loss = 0.3751
