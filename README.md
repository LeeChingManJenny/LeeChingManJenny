## Current Projects
#### Stock Prediction through news analysis
*This project is an individual coding exercise. Please look at my repo __Stock ANA__ if you are interested to it.*
This model is by calculating the features of news, and of stocks, to predict the precentage change of HSI.
It have criterion = nn.HuberLoss(delta=1.0) and Epoch 100: Train Loss = 0.3884, Val Loss = 0.3751


## Pervious Research Projects
#### Horse Racing Prediction and Betting Strategy
*We proposed 3 models involve conditional logistic regression and recurrent neural network to predict horse racing results.*

*Key tools used:* sklearn, Pytorch, beautifulsoup4

*Key Achievements:*
- Delivered a scalable framework for predicting horse racing result
- Identified optimal betting thresholds to balance risk and reward


#### Customer Analytics
*We conduct text analysis by sklearn, and classify customer categories with high precision by supervised learning models such as K Nearest Neighbor.*

*Key tools used:* sklearn, SQL

*Key Achievements:*
- Identify trends and clusters of customer's shopping records via principal component analysis
- Uncovered actionable customer segmentation insights to drive targeted marketing strategies.

#### Library System
*We implement a library system that records basic book borrowing and returning operations, update information of books exists in the library.*

*Key tools used:* SQL, JAVA

*Key Achievements:*
- Perform database management by JAVA programming
