## Individual Project
#### HSI Prediction via News Analysis
*This project is an individual coding exercise. Please look at my repo __HSI_pred_byNewsAna__ if you are interested to it.*

By calculating the features of news, and of stocks, this model is to predict the precentage change of HSI.
- 🕸️ Built custom news scraper for 10k+ financial headlines from news.futunn.com
- 🤖 Hybrid model (ARIMA + LSTM) that beats baseline accuracy by 18%  
- 🎯 79% directional accuracy for Hang Seng Index predictions:   It have criterion = nn.HuberLoss(delta=1.0) and Epoch 100: Train Loss = 0.3884, Val Loss = 0.3751
