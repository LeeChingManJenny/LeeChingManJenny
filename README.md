## Current Work
#### Stock Prediction through news analysis
*This project is just an individual coding exercise. Please look at my project if you are interested to it.*



## Pervious Research Projects
#### Horse Racing Prediction and Betting Strategy
*We proposed 3 models involve conditional logistic regression and recurrent neural network to predict horse racing results.*

*Key tools used:* sklearn, Pytorch, beautifulsoup4

*Key Achievements:*

- Identified optimal betting thresholds to balance risk and reward


#### Customer Analytics
*We conduct text analysis by sklearn, and classify customer categories with high precision by supervised learning models such as K Nearest Neighbor.*

*Key tools used:* sklearn, SQL

*Key Achievements:*
- Identify trends and clusters of customer's shopping records via principal component analysis
- Uncovered actionable customer segmentation insights to drive targeted marketing strategies.

#### Library System
*We implement a library system that records basic book borrowing and returning operations, update information of books exists in the library.*
